# Homelab

Ansible configs and a bunch of docker-composes for the many services I run in my homelab. If you want to run this yourself, you might want to change the ansible vars at `ansible/group_vars/all/vars.yml`.

## TODO

Install zsh, omz, zsh-autosuggestions and zsh-syntax-highlightning, copy .zshrc
